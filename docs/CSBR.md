# 1.  INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted CodeSigning Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet to issue Code Signing Certificates. Except where specifically stated or in the event of conflict in which case these Requirements will prevail, this document incorporates by reference the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates (“Baseline Requirements”), the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements and, in the case of EV Code Signing Certificates, the Guidelines For The Issuance And Management of Extended Validation Certificates as established by the CA/Browser Forum, copies of which are available on the CA/Browser Forum's website at https://www.cabforum.org. 

The scope of these Requirements includes all "Code Signing Certificates", as defined below, and associated Timestamp Authorities, and all Certification Authorities technically capable of issuing Code Signing Certificates, including any Root CA that is publicly trusted for code signing and all other CAs that might serve to complete the validation path to such Root CA. These Requirements do not address the issuance, use, maintenance, or revocation of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, where the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier (as defined in the Baseline Requirements).

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable trusted signing of code intended for public distribution, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of signed objects and accurately identifying the software publisher. The Requirements also serve to inform users about the purpose of signed code, help users make informed decisions when relying on Certificates, help establish the legitimacy of signed code, help maintain the trustworthiness of software Platforms, help users make informed software choices, and limit the spread of malware. Code Signing Certificates do not identify a particular software object, identifying only the publisher of software.

1.  Having the Requester provide a photo of the Requester holding the submitted government-issued photo ID where the photo is of sufficient quality to read both the name listed on the photo ID and the issuing authority; OR
2.  Having the CA perform an in-person or web camera-based verification of the Requester where an employee or contractor of the CA can see the Requester, review the Requester's photo ID, and confirm that the Requester is the individual identified in the submitted photo ID; OR
3.  Having the CA obtain an executed Declaration of Identity of the Requester that includes at least one unique biometric identifier (such as a fingerprint or handwritten signature). The CA MUST confirm the document's authenticity directly with the Verifying Person using contact information confirmed with a QIIS or QGIS; OR
4.  Verifying that the digital signature used to sign the Request under item (2) of [Section 3.2.3.1](#3231-individual-identity-verification) is a valid signature and originated from a Certificate issued at the appropriate level of assurance as evidenced by the certificate chain. Acceptable verification under this section includes validation that the Certificate was issued by a CA qualified by the entity responsible for adopting, enforcing, or maintaining the adopted standard and chains to an intermediate certificate or root certificate designated as complying with such standard.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

### 3.2.6 Criteria for interoperation

The CA SHOULD issue Code Signing and Timestamp Certificates that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with Certificates that chain up to each publicly trusted Root Certificate.

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA SHALL implement procedures to identify suspicious certificate requests as defined in BR Section 4.1.1.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY only issue to Applicants that meet the requirements specified in Section 8.5 of the EV Guidelines. The CA SHALL implement procedures to identify suspicious certificate requests as defined in EV Guidelines Section 11.12.2.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA MUST obtain from the Applicant a request for a certificate in a form prescribed by the CA and that complies with these Requirements. One request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the aging and updating requirement in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

Prior to signing Code, the Signing Service MUST obtain from the Applicant a signing request in a form prescribed by the Signing Service and that complies with these Requirements. One signing request MAY suffice for multiple Code Signatures for the same Applicant, subject to the requirements specified herein. The signing request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

The certificate requestor signing request MUST contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

The certificate request or signing request MAY include all factual information about the Applicant necessary to issue the Certificate or sign the Code, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA or Signing Service to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with these Requirements and the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. In cases where the certificate request or signing request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA or Signing Service MUST obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA or Signing Service MUST establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

In addition to the procedures required by BR Section 4.2.1, prior to issuing a Code Signing Certificate, each CA SHOULD check at least one database containing information about known or suspected producers, publishers, or distributors of Suspect Code, as identified or indicated by an Anti-Malware Organization and any database of deceptive names maintained by an Application Software Provider. The CA MUST determine whether the entity is identified as requesting a Code Signing Certificate from a High Risk Region of Concern. The CA MUST also maintain and check an internal database listing Certificates revoked due to Code Signatures on Suspect Code and previous certificate requests rejected by the CA.

A CA identifying a high risk application under this section MUST follow the additional procedures defined in [Section 4.2.2](#422-approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications) of this document to ensure that the applicant will protect its Private Keys and not sign Suspect Code.

\[These requirements do not specify a particular database and leave the decision of qualifying databases to the implementers.\]

Prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA SHALL perform "due diligence" verification as specified in EV Guidelines 11.13.

Methods 4, 5 and 7 of [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection) may be reused if Subscriber Private Key protection has been validated no more than 13 months prior to issuing the Code Signing Certificate. 

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY use the documents and data provided in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or completed the validation itself no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, use of documents, data, and previous validations performed per [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) SHALL be governed by the usage periods as defined in EV Guidelines Section 11.14.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

CAs MUST not issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity that the CA determined intentionally signed Suspect Code. The CA MUST keep meta-data about the reason for revoking a Code Signing Certificate as proof that the Code Signing Certificate was not revoked because the Applicant was intentionally signing Suspect Code.

CAs MAY issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity who is the victim of a documented Takeover Attack, resulting in either a loss of control of their code-signing service or loss of the Private Key associated with their Code Signing Certificate.

If the CA is aware that the Applicant was the victim of a Takeover Attack, the CA MUST verify that the Applicant is protecting its Code Signing Private Keys under [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2). The CA MUST verify the Applicant's compliance with [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2) through:
  1. Technical means that confirm the Private Keys are protected using the method described in [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2); or
  2. Relying on a report provided by the Applicant that is signed by an auditor who is approved by the CA and who has IT and security training or is a CISA.

Documentation of a Takeover Attack MAY include a police report (validated by the CA) or public news report that admits that the attack took place. The Subscriber MUST provide a report from an auditor with IT and security training or a CISA that provides information on how the Subscriber was storing and using Private keys and how the intended solution for better security meets the guidelines for improved security.

Except where issuance is expressly authorized by the Application Software Supplier, CAs MUST not issue new Code Signing Certificates to an entity where the CA is aware that the entity has been the victim of two Takeover Attacks or where the CA is aware that entity breached a requirement under this Section to protect Private Keys under [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2).

## 4.9 Certificate revocation and suspension

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

A CA MUST revoke a Code Signing Certificate in any of the four circumstances: (1) the Application Software Supplier requests revocation, (2) the subscriber requests revocation, (3) a third party provides information that leads the CA to believe that the certificate is compromised or is being used for Suspect Code, or (4) the CA otherwise decides that the certificate should be revoked. This section describes the CA's obligations for each scenario.

#### 4.9.1.1 Revocation Based on an Application Software Supplier's Request

If the Application Software Supplier requests the CA revoke because the Application Software Supplier believes that a Certificate attribute is deceptive, or that the Certificate is being used for malware, bundle ware, unwanted software, or some other illicit purpose, then the Application Software Supplier may request that the CA revoke the certificate.

Within two (2) business days of receipt of the request, the CA MUST either revoke the certificate or inform the Application Software Supplier that it is conducting an investigation.

If the CA decides to conduct an investigation, it MUST inform the Application Software Supplier whether or not it will revoke the Certificate, within two (2) business days.

If the CA decides that the revocation will have an unreasonable impact on its customer, then the CA MUST propose an alternative course of action to the Application Software Supplier based on its investigation.

#### 4.9.1.2 Revocation Based on the Subscriber's Request

The CA MUST revoke a Code Signing Certificate within one (1) business day if the Subscriber requests in writing that the CA revoke the Certificate or notifies the CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization.

#### 4.9.1.3 Revocation Based on Reported or Detected Compromise or Use in Malware

For all incidents involving malware, CAs SHALL revoke the Code Signing Certificate in accordance with and within the following maximum timeframes. Nothing herein prohibits a CA from revoking a Code Signing Certificate prior to these timeframes.

1.  The CA MUST contact the software publisher within one (1) business day after the CA is made aware of the incident.
2.  The CA MUST determine the volume of relying parties that are impacted (e.g., based on OCSP logs) within 72 hours after being made aware of the incident.
3.  The CA MUST request the software publisher send an acknowledgement to the CA within 72 hours of receipt of the request.
  a.  If the publisher responds within 72 hours, the CA and publisher MUST determine a "reasonable date" to revoke the certificate based on discussions with the CA.
  b.  If CA does not receive a response, the CA must notify the publisher that the CA will revoke in 7 days if no further response is received.
    i.  If the publisher responds within 7 days, the CA and the publisher will determine a "reasonable date" to revoke the certificate based on discussion with the CA.
    ii.  If no response is received after 7 days, the CA must revoke the certificate except if the CA has documented proof (e.g., OCSP logs) that the revocation will cause significant impact to the general public.

A CA revoking a Certificate because the Certificate was associated with signed Suspect Code or other fraudulent or illegal conduct SHOULD provide all relevant information and risk indicators to other CAs or industry groups. The CA SHOULD indicate whether its investigation found that the Suspect Code was a false positive or an inadvertent signing.

#### 4.9.1.4 Revocation of a Subordinate CA Certificate

As specified in BR Section 4.9.1.2.

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The CA MUST provide Anti-Malware Organizations, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions on how they can report suspected private key compromise, Certificate misuse, Certificates used to sign Suspect Code, Takeover Attacks, or other types of possible fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA MUST publicly disclose the instructions on its website.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

As specified in BR Section 4.9.3.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

The CA MUST maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to communicate with Anti-Malware Organizations, Application Software Suppliers, and law enforcement agencies and respond to high-priority Certificate Problem Reports, such as reports requesting revocation of Certificates used to sign malicious code, fraud, or other illegal conduct.

The CA MUST acknowledge receipt of plausible notices about Suspect Code signed with a certificate issued by the CA or a Subordinate CA.

The CA MUST begin investigating Certificate Problem Reports within twenty-four hours of receipt, and decide whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted based on at least the following criteria:

1.  The nature of the alleged problem (adware, spyware, malware, software bug, etc.),
2.  The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber,
3.  The entity making the report (for example, a notification from an Anti-Malware Organization or law enforcement agency carries more weight than an anonymous complaint), and
4.  Relevant legislation.

When revoking a Certificate, the CA SHOULD work with the Subscriber to estimate a date of when the revocation should occur in order to mitigate the impact of revocation on validly signed Code. For key compromise events, this date SHOULD be the earliest date of suspected compromise.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

 A Certificate MAY have a one-to-one relationship or one-to-many relationship with the signed Code. Regardless, revocation of a Certificate may invalidate the Code Signatures on all signed Code, some of which could be perfectly sound. Because of this, the CA MAY specify the time at which the Certificate is first considered to be invalid in the `revocationDate` field of a CRL entry or the `revocationTime` field of an OCSP response to time-bind the set of software affected by the revocation[^*], and software should continue to treat objects containing a timestamp dated before the revocation date as valid.

[^*]: Backdating the `revocationDate` field is an exception to best practice described in RFC 5280 (section 5.3.2); however, these Requirements specify the use of the `revocationDate` field to convey the “invalidity date” to support Application Software Supplier software implementations that process the `revocationDate` field as the date when the Certificate is first considered to be invalid.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: 
  * The Issuing CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate. The `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:
  * The Subordinate CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:
  * The Subordinate CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

CAs MAY provide OCSP responses for Code Signing Certificates and Timestamp Certificates for the time period specified in their CPS, which MAY be at least 10 years after the expiration of the certificate.

If the CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL support an OCSP capability using the GET method for Certificates issued in accordance with these Requirements.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:
  * If the Issuing CA provides OCSP responses, the Issuing CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:
  * If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every four days. OCSP responses from this service MUST have a maximum expiration time of ten days.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:
  * If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the Subordinate CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

Because some Application Software Suppliers utilize non-standard revocation mechanisms, CAs MUST, if requested by the Application Software Supplier and using a method of communication specified by the Application Software Vendor, notify the Application Software Supplier whenever the CA revokes a Code Signing Certificate because (i) the CA mis-issued the Certificate, (ii) the Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code, or (iii) there is a suspected or actual compromise of the Applicant's or CA's Private Key.

# 6.  TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

## 6.1 Key pair generation and installation

### 6.1.1 Key pair generation

#### 6.1.1.1 CA Key Pair Generation

As specified in BR Section 6.1.1.1.

#### 6.1.1.2 RA Key Pair Generation

#### 6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation

The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if the requested Public Key does not meet the requirements set forth in Sections [6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and BR Section 6.1.6, or if it has a known weak Private Key (such as a Debian weak key, see <http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>).

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber

If the CA or any Delegated Third Party is generating the Private Key on behalf of the Subscriber where the Private Keys will be transported to the Subscriber outside of the Signing Service's secure infrastructure, then the entity generating the Private Key MUST either transport the Private Key in hardware with an activation method that is equivalent to 128 bits of encryption or encrypt the Private Key with at least 128 bits of encryption strength. Allowed methods include using a 128-bit AES key to wrap the private key or storing the key in a PKCS 12 file encrypted with a randomly generated password of more than 16 characters containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for transport.

### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

### 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties

### 6.1.5 Key sizes

#### 6.1.5.1 Root and Subordinate CA key sizes

For Keys corresponding to Root and Subordinate CAs:

* If the Key is RSA, then the modulus MUST be at least 4096 bits in length. [^legacy_key_length]
* If the Key is ECDSA, then the curve MUST be one of NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521.
* If the Key is DSA, then one of the following key parameter options MUST be used:
  * Key length (`L`) of 2048 bits and modulus length (`N`) of 224 bits
  * Key length (`L`) of 2048 bits and modulus length (`N`) of 256 bits

[^legacy_key_length]: CAs MAY sign Cross-Certificates with Root CA RSA Private Keys whose modulus length is less than 4096 bits, provided that the Cross-Certificate is issued to a Root CA whose Public Key adheres to the key size requirements of this section. 

#### 6.1.5.2 Code signing Certificate and Timestamp Authority key sizes

For Keys corresponding to Subscriber code signing and Timestamp Authority Certificates:

* If the Key is RSA, then the modulus MUST be at least 3072 bits in length.
* If the Key is ECDSA, then the curve MUST be one of NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521.
* If the Key is DSA, then one of the following key parameter options MUST be used:
  * Key length (`L`) of 2048 bits and modulus length (`N`) of 224 bits
  * Key length (`L`) of 2048 bits and modulus length (`N`) of 256 bits

### 6.1.6 Public key parameters generation and quality checking

### 6.1.7 Key usage purposes

Private Keys corresponding to Root Certificates MUST NOT be used to sign Certificates or create other Signatures except in the following cases:

1.  Self-signed Certificates to represent the Root CA itself;
2.  Certificates for Subordinate CAs and Cross Certificates;
3.  Certificates for infrastructure purposes (administrative role certificates, internal CA operational device certificates);
4.  Certificates for OCSP Response verification; and
5.  Signatures for OCSP Responses.

## 6.2 Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls

### 6.2.1 Cryptographic module standards and controls

### 6.2.3 Private key escrow

### 6.2.4 Private key backup

### 6.2.5 Private key archival

### 6.2.6 Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module

For Certificates transported outside of a Signing Service's secure infrastructure, the CA or Signing Service MUST require, by contract, each Subscriber to generate their own Private Key and protect the Private Key in accordance with [Section 6.2.7.4](#6274-subscriber-private-key-protection-and-verification).

### 6.2.7 Private key storage on cryptographic module

#### 6.2.7.1 Private key storage for CA keys

Private Keys corresponding to CA Keys MUST be stored in accordance with BR Section 6.2.7.

#### 6.2.7.2 Private key storage for Timestamp Authorities

A Timestamp Authority MUST protect its signing key using a process that is at least to FIPS 140-2 Level 3, Common Criteria EAL 4+ (ALC\_FLR.2), or higher. The CA MUST protect its signing operations in accordance with the CA/Browser Forum's Network Security Guidelines.

#### 6.2.7.3 Private key storage for Signing Services

The Signing Service MUST ensure that a Subscriber's Private Key is generated, stored, and used in a secure environment that has controls to prevent theft or misuse. A Signing Service MUST enforce multi-factor authentication to access and authorize Code Signing and obtain a representation from the Subscriber that they will securely store the tokens required for multi-factor access. A system used to host a Signing Service MUST NOT be used for web browsing. The Signing Service MUST run a regularly updated antivirus solution to scan the service for possible virus infection. The Signing Service MUST comply with the Network Security Guidelines as a "Delegated Third Party".

For Code Signing Certificates, Signing Services shall protect Private Keys in a Hardware Crypto Module conforming to at least FIPS 140-2 level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+.

Techniques that MAY be used to satisfy this requirement include:

1.  Use of an HSM, verified by means of a manufacturer's certificate;
2.  A cloud-based key generation and protection solution with the following requirements:
    a.  Key creation, storage, and usage of Private Key must remain within the security boundaries of the cloud solution’s Hardware Crypto Module that conforms to the specified requirements;
    b.  Subscription at the level that manages the Private Key must be configured to log all access, operations, and configuration changes on the resources securing the Private Key.
3.	 A Hardware Crypto Module provided by the CA;
4.	 Contractual terms in the Subscriber Agreement requiring the Subscriber to protect the Private Key to a standard of at least FIPS 140-2 level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+ and with compliance being confirmed by means of an audit.

#### 6.2.7.4 Subscriber Private Key protection and verification 

The requirements in BR Section 6.2 apply equally to Code Signing Certificates.

##### 6.2.7.4.1 Subscriber Private Key protection

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates issued prior to November 15, 2022, the CA MUST obtain a representation from the Subscriber that the Subscriber will use one of the following options to generate and protect their Code Signing Certificate Private Keys:

1.  A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that generates and secures a Key Pair and that can document the Subscriber’s Private Key protection through a TPM key attestation. 
2.	 A suitable Hardware Crypto Module with a unit design form factor certified as conforming to at least FIPS 140-2 Level 2, Common Criteria EAL 4+, or equivalent. 
3.	 Another type of hardware storage token with a unit design form factor of SD Card or USB token (not necessarily certified as conformant with FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+). The Subscriber MUST also warrant that it will keep the token physically separate from the device that hosts the code signing function until a signing session is begun. 

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates issued prior to November 15, 2022, a CA MUST recommend that the Subscriber protect Private Keys using the method described in Section 6.2.7.4.1(1) or 6.2.7.4.1(2) over the method described in Section 6.2.7.4.1(3) and obligate the Subscriber to protect Private Keys in accordance with [Section 9.6.3](#963-subscriber-representations-and-warranties) (2).

For EV Code Signing Certificates issued prior to November 15, 2022, CAs SHALL ensure that the Subscriber’s Private Key is generated, stored and used in a Hardware Crypto Module that meets or exceeds the requirements of FIPS 140-2 level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+. Acceptable methods of satisfying this requirement include (but are not limited to) the following:

4.	 The CA ships a suitable Hardware Crypto Module, with a preinstalled Private Key, in the form of a smartcard or USB device or similar;
5.	 The Subscriber counter-signs certificate requests that can be verified by using a manufacturer’s certificate indicating that the Private Key is managed in a suitable Hardware Crypto Module;
6.	 The Subscriber provides a suitable IT audit indicating that its operating environment achieves a level of security at least equivalent to that of FIPS 140-2 level 2.

Effective November, 15, 2022, Subscriber Private Keys for Code Signing Certificates SHALL be protected per the following requirements.
The CA MUST obtain a contractual representation from the Subscriber that the Subscriber will use one of the following options to generate and protect their Code Signing Certificate Private Keys in a Hardware Crypto Module with a unit design form factor certified as conforming to at least FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+:

7.	 Subscriber uses a Hardware Crypto Module meeting the specified requirement;  
8.	 Subscriber uses a cloud-base key generation and protection solution with the following requirements:
    a.	Key creation, storage, and usage of Private Key must remain within the security boundaries of the cloud solution’s Hardware Crypto Module that conforms to the specified requirements;

One of the following methods MUST be employed to satisfy this requirement:

1.	 The CA ships a suitable Hardware Crypto Module, with one or more pre-generated Key Pairs that the CA has generated using the Hardware Crypto Module; 
2.	 The Subscriber counter-signs certificate requests that can be verified by using a manufacturer’s certificate, commonly known as key attestation, indicating that the Private Key was generated in a non-exportable way using a suitable Hardware Crypto Module; 
3.	 The Subscriber uses a CA prescribed crypto library and a suitable Hardware Crypto Module combination for the Key Pair generation and storage;
4.	 The Subscriber provides an internal or external IT audit indicating that it is only using a suitable Hardware Crypto Module to generate Key Pairs to be associated with Code Signing Certificates;
5.	 The Subscriber provides a suitable report from the cloud-based key protection solution subscription and resources configuration protecting the Private Key in a suitable Hardware Crypto Module;
6.	 The CA relies on a report provided by the Applicant that is signed by an auditor who is approved by the CA and who has IT and security training or is a CISA witnesses the Key Pair creation in a suitable Hardware Crypto Module solution including a cloud-based key generation and protection solution;
7.	 The Subscriber provides an agreement that they use a Signing Service meeting the requirements of [Section 6.2.7.3](#6273-private-key-storage-for-signing-services);
8.	 Any other method the CA uses to satisfy this requirement. The CA SHALL specify and describe in detail those other methods in its Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement, and SHALL propose those methods to the CA/Browser Forum Code Signing Working Group for inclusion into these requirements until November 15, 2022, using the questions@cabforum.org mailing list.

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) code signing(1)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.1`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for EV Code Signing Certificates follows:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(3)}` (`2.23.140.1.3`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Timestamp Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) timestamping(2)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.2`)

#### 7.1.6.2 Root CA Certificates

A Root CA Certificate SHOULD NOT contain the certificatePolicies extension.

#### 7.1.6.3 Subordinate CA Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is not an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the policy identifier that indicates the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements (i.e. either the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifiers as specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) or identifiers defined by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement), and
2. MUST NOT contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`).

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that issues Code Signing Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to indicate the Subordinate CA's compliance with these Requirements, and
2. MAY contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier.

A Certificate issued after 31 March 2022 to a Subordinate CA that issues Timestamp Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to 
indicate the Subordinate CA’s compliance with these Requirements, and  
2. MAY contain the “anyPolicy” identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier. 

A Subordinate CA MUST represent, in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, that all Certificates containing a policy identifier indicating compliance with these Requirements are issued and managed in accordance with these Requirements.

####  7.1.6.4  Subscriber Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subscriber MUST contain one or more policy identifier(s), defined by the CA, in the Certificate's certificatePolicies extension that indicates adherence to and compliance with these Requirements. CAs complying with these Requirements MAY also assert the reserved policy OIDs in such Certificates.

The CA MUST document in its Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement that the Certificates it issues containing the specified policy identifier(s) are managed in accordance with these Requirements.

### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints extension

### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

## 7.2 CRL profile

The serial number of a revoked Certificate MUST remain on the CRL for at least 10 years after the expiration of the Certificate. Application Software Suppliers MAY require the CA to support a longer life-time in its contract with the CA. If a Code Signing Certificate contains the Lifetime Signing OID, the Code Signature becomes invalid when the Code Signing Certificate expires, even if the Code Signature is timestamped. Because the Lifetime Signing OID is intended to be used with test purposes only, a CA MAY cease maintaining revocation information for a Code Signing Certificate with the Lifetime Signing OID after the Code Signing Certificate expires.

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent CRL entries for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.2.1 Version number(s)

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

If a CRL has a `thisUpdate` field value of 2022-07-01 00:00:00 UTC or later and the CA includes the Invalidity Date CRL entry extension in a CRL entry for a Code Signing Certificate, then the time encoded in the Invalidity Date CRL extension SHALL be equal to the time encoded in the `revocationDate` field of the CRL entry.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent OCSP responses for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA and/or all Signing Services MUST, at all times:

1.  Comply with all laws applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in each jurisdiction where it operates,
2.  Comply with these Requirements,
3.  Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section, and
4.  If a CA, be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.
5.  In all cases, the CA MUST contractually obligate each Delegated Third Party to comply with all applicable requirements in these Requirements and to perform them as required of the CA itself. The CA MUST enforce these obligations and internally audit each Delegated Third Party’s compliance with these Requirements on an annual basis. 

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST be fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA MUST successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment MUST be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates and MUST be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Code Signing Certificate.

Audits MUST be conducted for all obligations under these Guidelines, including timestamping and signing services, regardless of whether they are performed directly by the CA or by a Delegated Third Party. Functions performed by a Delegated Third Party MUST be included in the CA's audit or the CA MUST obtain an audit report from the Delegated Third Party. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA MUST not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party MUST NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit).

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

As specified in BR Section 8.2.

## 8.3 Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA MUST undergo a conformity assessment audit for compliance with these Requirements performed in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates v1.0.1 or newer"; or
2.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Extended Validation Code Signing v1.4.1 or newer"; or
3.  “WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer” AND “WebTrust for Certification Authorities – Code Signing Baseline Requirements v2.0 or newer”; or 
4.  ETSI EN 319 411-1, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
5.  If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either (a) encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or (b) consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.

Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in BR Section 8.2.

The audit MUST cover all CA obligations under these Guidelines regardless of whether they are performed directly by the CA, an RA, or subcontractor.

## 8.5 Actions taken as a result of deficiency

## 8.6 Communication of results

As specified in BR Section 8.6.

## 8.7 Self-audits

CAs must abide by the self-audit requirements of these Guidelines. During the period in which it issues Code Signing Certificates, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self-audits against a randomly selected sample of at least three percent of the Non-EV Code Signing Certificates and at least three percent of the EV Code Signing Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken. For all Code Signing Certificates where the final cross-correlation and due diligence requirements of Section 8 of these Guidelines is performed by an RA, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self-audits against a randomly selected sample of at least six percent of the Non-EV Code Signing Certificates and at least six percent of the EV Code Signing Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken.

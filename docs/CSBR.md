# 1.  INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted CodeSigning Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet to issue Code Signing Certificates. 

The scope of these Requirements includes all "Code Signing Certificates", as defined below, and associated Timestamp Authorities, and all Certification Authorities technically capable of issuing Code Signing Certificates, including any Root CA that is publicly trusted for code signing and all other CAs that might serve to complete the validation path to such Root CA. These Requirements do not address the issuance, use, maintenance, or revocation of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, where the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier (as defined in the Baseline Requirements).

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable trusted signing of code intended for public distribution, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of signed objects and accurately identifying the software publisher. The Requirements also serve to inform users about the purpose of signed code, help users make informed decisions when relying on Certificates, help establish the legitimacy of signed code, help maintain the trustworthiness of software Platforms, help users make informed software choices, and limit the spread of malware. Code Signing Certificates do not identify a particular software object, identifying only the publisher of software.

## 1.2 Document name and identification

If the Subject's or Subject's Affiliate's, Parent Company's, or Subsidiary Company's date of formation, as indicated by either a QIIS or QGIS, was less than three years prior to the date of the Certificate Request, verify the identity of the Certificate Requester. Effective 1 November 2021, the method used to verify the identity of the Certificate Requester SHALL be per [Section 3.2.3.1](#3231-individual-identity-verification).

##### 3.2.2.1.1 Identity

If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name or address of an organization, the CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation. The CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the Applicant using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;
3. A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or
4. An Attestation Letter.

The CA MAY use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address.

Alternatively, the CA MAY verify the address of the Applicant (but not the identity of the Applicant) using a utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.

##### 3.2.2.1.2 DBA/Tradename

If the Subject Identity Information is to include a DBA or tradename, the CA SHALL verify the Applicant's right to use the DBA/tradename using at least one of the following:

5. A utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.


#### 3.2.2.2 Authentication of organization identity for EV Code Signing Certificates

Before issuing a EV Code Signing Certificate, the CA MUST ensure that all Subject organization information to be included in the EV Code Signing Certificate conforms to the requirements of, and is verified in accordance with the EV Guidelines and matches the information confirmed and documented by the CA pursuant to its verification processes. Such verification processes are intended to accomplish the following:

1.  Verify Applicant's existence and identity, including;
  a.  Verify the Applicant's legal existence and identity (as more fully set forth in [Section 3.2.2.2.1](#32221-verification-of-applicants-legal-existence-and-identity) herein),
  b.  Verify the Applicant's physical existence (business presence at a physical address), and
  c.  Verify the Applicant's operational existence (business activity).
2.  Verify the Applicant's authorization for the EV Code Signing Certificate, including;
  a.  Verify the name, title, and authority of the Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, and Certificate Requester,
  b.  Verify that a Contract Signer signed the Subscriber Agreement or that a duly authorized Applicant Representative acknowledged and agreed to the Terms of Use; and
  c.  Verify that a Certificate Approver has signed or otherwise approved the EV Code Signing Certificate Request.

As a general rule, the CA is responsible for taking all verification steps reasonably necessary to satisfy each of the Verification Requirements set forth in the subsections below. The Acceptable Methods of Verification are set forth in the EV Guidelines. In all cases, however, the CA is responsible for taking any additional verification steps that may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the applicable Verification Requirement.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

Prior to issuing a Code Signing Certificate to an Individual Applicant, the CA MUST verify the Subject's Identity and authenticity of the Identity as follows.

### 3.2.3.1 Individual identity verification

The CA MUST verify the Applicant's identity using one of the following processes:

1.  The CA MUST obtain a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Certificate Requester's face, of at least one currently valid government-issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, military ID, national ID, or equivalent document type). The CA MUST inspect the copy for any indication of alteration or falsification. The CA MUST also verify the address of the Certificate Requester using (i) a government-issued photo ID, (ii) a QIIS or QGIS, or (iii) an access code to activate the Certificate where the access code was physically mailed to the Certificate Requester; OR
2.  The CA MUST have the Certificate Requester digitally sign the Certificate Request using a valid personal Certificate that was issued under one of the following adopted standards: Qualified Certificates issued pursuant to ETSI TS 101 862, IGTF, Adobe Signing Certificate issued under the AATL or CDS program, the Kantara identity assurance framework at level 2, NIST SP 800-63 at level 2, or the FBCA CP at Basic or higher assurance.

### 3.2.3.2 Authenticity of Certificate requests for Individual Applicants

The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Certificate Request using one of the following:

1.  Having the Certificate Requester provide a photo of the Certificate Requester holding the submitted government-issued photo ID where the photo is of sufficient quality to read both the name listed on the photo ID and the issuing authority; OR
2.  Having the CA perform an in-person or web camera-based verification of the Certificate Requester where an employee or contractor of the CA can see the Certificate Requester, review the Certificate Requester's photo ID, and confirm that the Certificate Requester is the individual identified in the submitted photo ID; OR
3.  Having the CA obtain an executed Declaration of Identity of the Certificate Requester that includes at least one unique biometric identifier (such as a fingerprint or handwritten signature). The CA MUST confirm the document's authenticity directly with the Verifying Person using contact information confirmed with a QIIS or QGIS; OR
4.  Verifying that the digital signature used to sign the Request under item (2) of [Section 3.2.3.1](#3231-individual-identity-verification) is a valid signature and originated from a Certificate issued at the appropriate level of assurance as evidenced by the certificate chain. Acceptable verification under this section includes validation that the Certificate was issued by a CA qualified by the entity responsible for adopting, enforcing, or maintaining the adopted standard and chains to an intermediate certificate or root certificate designated as complying with such standard.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing Subject Identity Information is an organization, the CA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representative's certificate request.

The CA MAY use the sources listed in [Section 3.2.2.1.1](#32211-identity) to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA MAY establish the authenticity of the certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the CA deems appropriate.

In addition, the CA SHALL establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then the CA SHALL NOT accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for interoperation

The CA SHOULD issue Code Signing and Timestamp Certificates that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with Certificates that chain up to each publicly trusted Root Certificate. At a minimum, the CA SHOULD issue and make available to Application Software Suppliers upon request Code Signing and Timestamp Certificates that are valid (non-revoked and unexpired).

### 3.2.7 Data source accuracy

Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA SHALL evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The CA SHOULD consider the following during its evaluation:

1. The age of the information provided,
2. The frequency of updates to the information source,
3. The data provider and purpose of the data collection,
4. The public accessibility of the data availability, and
5. The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

Databases maintained by the CA, its owner, or its affiliated companies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under this [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

## 3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests

### 3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key

### 3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation

## 3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request

# 4.  CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Certificate Application

### 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application

For EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY only issue to Applicants that meet the requirements specified in Section 8.5 of the EV Guidelines. The CA SHALL implement procedures to identify suspicious certificate requests as defined in EV Guidelines Section 11.12.2.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA MUST obtain from the Applicant a request for a certificate in a form prescribed by the CA and that complies with these Requirements. One request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the aging and updating requirement in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

Prior to signing Code, the Signing Service MUST obtain from the Applicant a signing request in a form prescribed by the Signing Service and that complies with these Requirements. One signing request MAY suffice for multiple Code Signatures for the same Applicant, subject to the requirements specified herein. The signing request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

The certificate requestor signing request MUST contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

The certificate request or signing request MAY include all factual information about the Applicant necessary to issue the Certificate or sign the Code, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA or Signing Service to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with these Requirements and the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. In cases where the certificate request or signing request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA or Signing Service MUST obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA or Signing Service MUST establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

Prior to issuing a Code Signing Certificate, each CA SHOULD check at least one database containing information about known or suspected producers, publishers, or distributors of Suspect Code, as identified or indicated by an Anti-Malware Organization and any database of deceptive names maintained by an Application Software Provider. The CA MUST determine whether the entity is identified as requesting a Code Signing Certificate from a High Risk Region of Concern. The CA MUST also maintain and check an internal database listing Certificates revoked due to Code Signatures on Suspect Code and previous certificate requests rejected by the CA.

A CA identifying a high risk application under this section MUST follow the additional procedures defined in [Section 4.2.2](#422-approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications) of this document to ensure that the applicant will protect its Private Keys and not sign Suspect Code.

\[These requirements do not specify a particular database and leave the decision of qualifying databases to the implementers.\]

Prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA SHALL perform "due diligence" verification as specified in EV Guidelines 11.13.

Methods 4, 5 and 7 of [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection) may be reused if Subscriber Private Key protection has been validated no more than 13 months prior to issuing the Code Signing Certificate. 

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY use the documents and data provided in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or completed the validation itself no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, use of documents, data, and previous validations performed per [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) SHALL be governed by the usage periods as defined in EV Guidelines Section 11.14.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

CAs MUST not issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity that the CA determined intentionally signed Suspect Code. The CA MUST keep meta-data about the reason for revoking a Code Signing Certificate as proof that the Code Signing Certificate was not revoked because the Applicant was intentionally signing Suspect Code.

CAs MAY issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity who is the victim of a documented Takeover Attack, resulting in either a loss of control of their code-signing service or loss of the Private Key associated with their Code Signing Certificate.

If the CA is aware that the Applicant was the victim of a Takeover Attack, the CA MUST verify that the Applicant is protecting its Code Signing Private Keys under [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2). The CA MUST verify the Applicant's compliance with [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2) through:

  1. Technical means that confirm the Private Keys are protected using the method described in [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2); or
  2. Relying on a report provided by the Applicant that is signed by an auditor who is approved by the CA and who has IT and security training or is a CISA.

Documentation of a Takeover Attack MAY include a police report (validated by the CA) or public news report that admits that the attack took place. The Subscriber MUST provide a report from an auditor with IT and security training or a CISA that provides information on how the Subscriber was storing and using Private keys and how the intended solution for better security meets the guidelines for improved security.

Except where issuance is expressly authorized by the Application Software Supplier, CAs MUST not issue new Code Signing Certificates to an entity where the CA is aware that the entity has been the victim of two Takeover Attacks or where the CA is aware that entity breached a requirement under this Section to protect Private Keys under [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2).

5. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber’s Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed; or
6. The CA has reasonable assurance that a Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code.
 
The CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and SHALL revoke a Certificate within 5 days if one or more of the following occurs:

7. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of Section 6.1.5 and Section 6.1.6; 
8. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused. 
9. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use. 
10. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate. 
11. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. 
12. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate. 
13. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository. 
14. Revocation is required by the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. 
 
The CA MAY delay revocation based on a request from Application Software Suppliers where immediate revocation has a potentially large negative impact to the ecosystem.

 
**Note:** Nothing herein prohibits a CA from revoking a Code Signing Certificate prior to these time frames.
 
#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate
 
The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:
 
1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
4. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
5. The Issuing CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
6. The Issuing CA determines that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;
7. The Issuing CA or Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide revocation support for the Certificate;
8. The Issuing CA's or Subordinate CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository; or
9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.
 

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The CA MUST provide Anti-Malware Organizations, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions on how they can report suspected private key compromise, Certificate misuse, Certificates used to sign Suspect Code, Takeover Attacks, or other types of possible fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA MUST publicly disclose the instructions on its website.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

The CA MUST maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to communicate with Anti-Malware Organizations, Application Software Suppliers, and law enforcement agencies and respond to high-priority Certificate Problem Reports, such as reports requesting revocation of Certificates used to sign malicious code, fraud, or other illegal conduct.

The CA MUST acknowledge receipt of plausible notices about Suspect Code signed with a certificate issued by the CA or a Subordinate CA.

The CA MUST begin investigating Certificate Problem Reports within twenty-four hours of receipt, and decide whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted based on at least the following criteria:

1.  The nature of the alleged problem (adware, spyware, malware, software bug, etc.),
2.  The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber,
3.  The entity making the report (for example, a notification from an Anti-Malware Organization or law enforcement agency carries more weight than an anonymous complaint), and
4.  Relevant legislation.

When revoking a Certificate, the CA SHOULD work with the Subscriber to estimate a date of when the revocation should occur in order to mitigate the impact of revocation on validly signed Code. For key compromise events, this date SHOULD be the earliest date of suspected compromise.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

 A Certificate MAY have a one-to-one relationship or one-to-many relationship with the signed Code. Regardless, revocation of a Certificate may invalidate the Code Signatures on all signed Code, some of which could be perfectly sound. Because of this, the CA MAY specify the time at which the Certificate is first considered to be invalid in the `revocationDate` field of a CRL entry or the `revocationTime` field of an OCSP response to time-bind the set of software affected by the revocation[^*], and software should continue to treat objects containing a timestamp dated before the revocation date as valid.

[^*]: Backdating the `revocationDate` field is an exception to best practice described in RFC 5280 (section 5.3.2); however, these Requirements specify the use of the `revocationDate` field to convey the “invalidity date” to support Application Software Supplier software implementations that process the `revocationDate` field as the date when the Certificate is first considered to be invalid.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: 

  * The Issuing CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate. The `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:

  * The Subordinate CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:

  * The Subordinate CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs

No stipulation.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
   revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as
defined by RFC6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

Effective 2023-09-15, OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019.

Effective 2023-09-15, the validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the `thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate` field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

CAs MAY provide OCSP responses for Code Signing Certificates and Timestamp Certificates for the time period specified in their CPS, which MAY be at least 10 years after the expiration of the certificate.

If the CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL support an OCSP capability using the GET method for Certificates issued in accordance with these Requirements.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:

  * If the Issuing CA provides OCSP responses, the Issuing CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:

  * If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every four days. OCSP responses from this service MUST have a maximum expiration time of ten days.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:

  * If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the Subordinate CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate.

A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate serial number that is not "assigned", then the responder MUST NOT respond with a "good" status.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

Because some Application Software Suppliers utilize non-standard revocation mechanisms, CAs MUST, if requested by the Application Software Supplier and using a method of communication specified by the Application Software Vendor, notify the Application Software Supplier whenever the CA revokes a Code Signing Certificate because (i) the CA mis-issued the Certificate, (ii) the Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code, or (iii) there is a suspected or actual compromise of the Applicant's or CA's Private Key.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise

See [Section 4.9.1](#491-circumstances-for-revocation).

### 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension

Effective 2023-09-15, the Repository MUST NOT include entries that indicate that a Certificate is suspended.

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber

If the CA or any Delegated Third Party is generating the Private Key on behalf of the Subscriber where the Private Keys will be transported to the Subscriber outside of the Signing Service's secure infrastructure, then the entity generating the Private Key MUST either transport the Private Key in hardware with an activation method that is equivalent to 128 bits of encryption or encrypt the Private Key with at least 128 bits of encryption strength. Allowed methods include using a 128-bit AES key to wrap the private key or storing the key in a PKCS 12 file encrypted with a randomly generated password of more than 16 characters containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for transport.

Parties other than the Subscriber SHALL NOT archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an organization not affiliated with the Subscriber, then the CA SHALL revoke all certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

### 7.1.5 Name constraints

### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

This section sets forth minimum requirements for the content of the Subscriber, Subordinate CA, and Root CA Certificates, as they relate to the identification of Certificate Policy.

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) code signing(1)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.1`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for EV Code Signing Certificates follows:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(3)}` (`2.23.140.1.3`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Timestamp Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) timestamping(2)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.2`)

#### 7.1.6.2 Root CA Certificates

A Root CA Certificate SHOULD NOT contain the certificatePolicies extension.

#### 7.1.6.3 Subordinate CA Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is not an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the policy identifier that indicates the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements (i.e. either the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifiers as specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) or identifiers defined by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement), and
2. MUST NOT contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`).

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that issues Code Signing Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to indicate the Subordinate CA's compliance with these Requirements, and
2. MAY contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier.

A Certificate issued after 31 March 2022 to a Subordinate CA that issues Timestamp Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to 
indicate the Subordinate CA’s compliance with these Requirements, and  
2. MAY contain the “anyPolicy” identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier. 

A Subordinate CA MUST represent, in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, that all Certificates containing a policy identifier indicating compliance with these Requirements are issued and managed in accordance with these Requirements.

####  7.1.6.4  Subscriber Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subscriber MUST contain one or more policy identifier(s), defined by the CA, in the Certificate's certificatePolicies extension that indicates adherence to and compliance with these Requirements. CAs complying with these Requirements MAY also assert the reserved policy OIDs in such Certificates.

The CA MUST document in its Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement that the Certificates it issues containing the specified policy identifier(s) are managed in accordance with these Requirements.

### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints extension

### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

## 7.2 CRL profile

The serial number of a revoked Certificate MUST remain on the CRL for at least 10 years after the expiration of the Certificate. Application Software Suppliers MAY require the CA to support a longer life-time in its contract with the CA. If a Code Signing Certificate contains the Lifetime Signing OID, the Code Signature becomes invalid when the Code Signing Certificate expires, even if the Code Signature is timestamped. Because the Lifetime Signing OID is intended to be used with test purposes only, a CA MAY cease maintaining revocation information for a Code Signing Certificate with the Lifetime Signing OID after the Code Signing Certificate expires.

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent CRL entries for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.2.1 Version number(s)

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

If a CRL has a `thisUpdate` field value of 2022-07-01 00:00:00 UTC or later and the CA includes the Invalidity Date CRL entry extension in a CRL entry for a Code Signing Certificate, then the time encoded in the Invalidity Date CRL extension SHALL be equal to the time encoded in the `revocationDate` field of the CRL entry.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent OCSP responses for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA and/or all Signing Services MUST, at all times:

1.  Comply with all laws applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in each jurisdiction where it operates,
2.  Comply with these Requirements,
3.  Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section, and
4.  If a CA, be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.
5.  In all cases, the CA MUST contractually obligate each Delegated Third Party to comply with all applicable requirements in these Requirements and to perform them as required of the CA itself. The CA MUST enforce these obligations and internally audit each Delegated Third Party’s compliance with these Requirements on an annual basis. 

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST be fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA MUST successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment MUST be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates and MUST be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Code Signing Certificate.

Audits MUST be conducted for all obligations under these Guidelines, including timestamping and signing services, regardless of whether they are performed directly by the CA or by a Delegated Third Party. Functions performed by a Delegated Third Party MUST be included in the CA's audit or the CA MUST obtain an audit report from the Delegated Third Party. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA MUST not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party MUST NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit).

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed by WebTrust;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage.

## 8.3 Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA MUST undergo a conformity assessment audit for compliance with these Requirements performed in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates v1.0.1 or newer"; or
2.  For Audit Periods starting before November 1st, 2020: "WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer" AND "WebTrust for Certification Authorities -- Extended Validation Code Signing v1.4.1 or newer"; or
3.  “WebTrust for CAs v2.0 or newer” AND “WebTrust for Certification Authorities – Code Signing Baseline Requirements v2.0 or newer”; or 
4.  ETSI EN 319 411-1, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
5.  If a government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either (a) encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or (b) consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.

Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

The audit MUST cover all CA obligations under these Guidelines regardless of whether they are performed directly by the CA, an RA, or subcontractor.

## 8.5 Actions taken as a result of deficiency

## 8.6 Communication of results

The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA MUST make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report MUST contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. name of the organization being audited;
2. name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. the SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the certificates (and associated keys);
5. a list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. the start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. the point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. the date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; and
10. (for audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g. DVCP, OVCP, NCP, NCP+, LCP, EVCP, EVCP+, QCP-w, Part 1 (General Requirements), and/or Part 2 (Requirements for Trust Service Providers).
11. (for audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information MUST be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure it is publicly available.

The Audit Report MUST be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report MUST be uppercase letters and MUST NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds.

## 8.7 Self-audits

CAs must abide by the self-audit requirements of these Guidelines. During the period in which it issues Code Signing Certificates, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self-audits against a randomly selected sample of at least three percent of the Non-EV Code Signing Certificates and at least three percent of the EV Code Signing Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken. For all Code Signing Certificates where the final cross-correlation and due diligence requirements of Section 8 of these Guidelines is performed by an RA, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self-audits against a randomly selected sample of at least six percent of the Non-EV Code Signing Certificates and at least six percent of the EV Code Signing Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties

The CA or Signing Service MUST require, as part of the Subscriber Agreement, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties set forth in this section, as applicable, for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries, either:
1.  The Applicant’s agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA, or
2.  The Applicant’s acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the certificate request. The CA MAY use an electronic or “click‐through” Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each certificate request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future certificate requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

10. **Termination of Use of Certificate:** To promptly cease using the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key listed in a Certificate upon expiration or revocation of the Certificate.
11. **Responsiveness:** An obligation to respond to the CA's instructions concerning Key Compromise or Certificate misuse within a specified time period.
12. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance:** An acknowledgement and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the Terms of Use or the Subscriber Agreement.

### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

The CA MUST contractually obligate each Signing Service to inform the CA if the Signing Service becomes aware (by whatever means) that the Signing Service has signed Suspect Code. The CA MUST require the Signing Service to request revocation of the affected Certificate and provide immediate notice to the CA if the Signing Service's private key, or private key activation data, is compromised or believed to be compromised. The CA MUST revoke the affected Certificate upon request by the Signing Service or if the CA determines the Signing Service failed to notify the CA within 24 hours after identifying a private key compromise.

Signing Services MUST obtain the Subscriber's commitment to:

1.  Use such signing services solely for authorized purposes that comply with the Subscriber Agreement/Terms of Use, these Requirements, and all applicable laws,
2.  Not knowingly submit software for Code Signature that contains Suspect Code, and
3.  Inform the Signing Service if it is discovered (by whatever means) that Code submitted to the Signing Service for Code Signature contained Suspect Code

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

## 9.8 Limitations of liability

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, CAs MAY limit their liability as described in this Section 9.8 for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, but MUST NOT limit its liability to Subscribers or Relying Parties for legally recognized and provable claims to a monetary amount less than two thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per EV Code Signing Certificate.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

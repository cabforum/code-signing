# 1.  INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted CodeSigning Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet to issue Code Signing Certificates. 

The scope of these Requirements includes all "Code Signing Certificates", as defined below, and associated Timestamp Authorities, and all Certification Authorities technically capable of issuing Code Signing Certificates, including any Root CA that is publicly trusted for code signing and all other CAs that might serve to complete the validation path to such Root CA. These Requirements do not address the issuance, use, maintenance, or revocation of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, where the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier (as defined in the Baseline Requirements).

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable trusted signing of code intended for public distribution, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of signed objects and accurately identifying the software publisher. The Requirements also serve to inform users about the purpose of signed code, help users make informed decisions when relying on Certificates, help establish the legitimacy of signed code, help maintain the trustworthiness of software Platforms, help users make informed software choices, and limit the spread of malware. Code Signing Certificates do not identify a particular software object, identifying only the publisher of software.

## 1.2 Document name and identification

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates:

   2. **Basis of Opinion**: The text of the Verified Accountant Letter MUST make clear that the Accounting Practitioner is acting on behalf of the Applicant and that the information in the letter is based on the Accounting Practitioner's stated familiarity with the relevant facts and the exercise of the practitioner's professional judgment and expertise. The Verified Accountant Letter MAY also include disclaimers and other limitations customary in the Accounting Practitioner's jurisdiction, provided that the scope of the disclaimed responsibility is not so great as to eliminate any substantial risk (financial, professional, and/or reputational) to the Accounting Practitioner, should the Verified Accountant Letter prove to be erroneous. Acceptable forms of Verified Accountant Letter are attached as [Appendix C](#appendix-c---sample-accountant-letters-confirming-specified-information).
   3. **Authenticity**: To confirm the authenticity of the accountant's opinion, the CA MUST make a telephone call or send a copy of the Verified Accountant Letter back to the Accounting Practitioner at the address, phone number, facsimile, or (if available) e-mail address for the Accounting Practitioner listed with the authority responsible for registering or licensing such Accounting Practitioners and obtain confirmation from the Accounting Practitioner or the Accounting Practitioner's assistant that the accountant letter is authentic. If a phone number is not available from the licensing authority, the CA MAY use the number listed for the Accountant in records provided by the applicable phone company, QGIS, or QIIS.
       
      In circumstances where the opinion is digitally signed, in a manner that confirms the authenticity of the document and the identity of the signer, as verified by the CA in Section 3.2.2.2.10.2 (2)(i), no further verification of authenticity is required.

One request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the aging and updating requirement in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

The certificate request MAY include all factual information about the Applicant necessary to issue the Certificate, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with these Requirements and the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. In cases where the certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA MUST obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA MUST establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

Prior to issuing a Code Signing Certificate, each CA SHOULD check at least one database containing information about known or suspected producers, publishers, or distributors of Suspect Code, as identified or indicated by an Anti-Malware Organization and any database of deceptive names maintained by an Application Software Provider. The CA MUST also maintain and check an internal database listing Certificates revoked due to Code Signatures on Suspect Code and previous certificate requests rejected by the CA. The CA MUST use this internal database to follow the additional procedures defined in [Section 4.2.2](#422-approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications) of this document to ensure that the Applicant will protect its Private Keys and not sign Suspect Code.

Prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA SHALL perform "due diligence" verification as specified in [Section 3.2.9](#329-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence).

Methods 4, 5 and 7 of [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection) may be reused if Subscriber Private Key protection has been validated no more than 13 months prior to issuing the Code Signing Certificate. 

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY use the documents and data provided in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or completed the validation itself no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, use of documents, data, and previous validations performed per [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) SHALL be governed by the usage periods as defined in [Section 4.2.1.1](#4211-requirements-for-re-use-of-existing-documentation-for-ev-code-signing-certificates).

#### 4.2.1.1 Requirements for Re-use of Existing Documentation for EV Code Signing Certificates

For each EV Certificate Request, including requests to renew existing EV Certificates, the CA MUST perform all authentication and verification tasks required to ensure that the request is properly authorized by the Applicant and that the information in the EV Code Signing Certificate is still accurate and valid. This section sets forth the age limitations for the use of documentation collected by the CA for EV Code Signing Certificates.

##### 4.2.1.1.1 Validation For Existing EV Subscribers

If an Applicant has a currently valid EV Code Signing Certificate issued by the CA, a CA MAY rely on its prior authentication and verification of:

1. The Principal Individual verified under [Section 3.2.2.2.1.2](#322212-acceptable-method-of-verification) (4) if the individual is the same person as verified by the CA in connection with the Applicant's previously issued and currently valid EV Code Signing Certificate;
2. The Applicant's Place of Business under [Section 3.2.2.2.3.1](#322231-address-of-applicants-place-of-business);
3. The Applicant's Verified Method of Communication required by [Section 3.2.2.2.4](#32224-verified-method-of-communication) but still MUST perform the verification required by subsection (2) (ii);
4. The Applicant's Operational Existence under [Section 3.2.2.2.5](#32225-verification-of-applicants-operational-existence); and
5. The Name, Title, Agency and Authority of the Contract Signer, and Certificate Approver, under [Section 3.2.2.2.7](#32227-verification-of-name-title-and-authority-of-contract-signer-and-certificate-approver-).

##### 4.2.1.1.2 Re-issuance Requests

A CA may rely on a previously verified EV Code Signing Certificate request to issue a replacement certificate, so long as the certificate being referenced was not revoked due to fraud or other illegal conduct, if:

1. The expiration date of the replacement certificate is the same as the expiration date of the EV Code Signing Certificate that is being replaced, and
2. The Subject Information of the Certificate is the same as the Subject in the EV Code Signing Certificate that is being replaced.

##### 4.2.1.1.3 Age of Validated Data

1. Except for reissuance of an EV Code Signing Certificate under [Section 4.2.1.1.2](#42112-re-issuance-requests) and except when permitted otherwise in [Section 4.2.1.1.1](#42111-validation-for-existing-ev-subscribers), the age of all data used to support issuance of an EV Code Signing Certificate (before revalidation is required) SHALL NOT exceed the following limits:

   1. Legal existence and identity – 398 days;
   2. Assumed name – 398 days;
   3. Address of Place of Business – 398 days;
   4. Verified Method of Communication – 398 days;
   5. Operational existence – 398 days;
   6. Name, Title, Agency, and Authority – 398 days, unless a contract between the CA and the Applicant specifies a different term, in which case, the term specified in such contract controls.  For example, the contract MAY include the perpetual assignment of EV roles until revoked by the Applicant or CA, or until the contract expires or is terminated.

2. The 398-day period set forth above SHALL begin to run on the date the information was collected by the CA.
3. The CA MAY reuse a previously submitted EV Certificate Request, Subscriber Agreement, or Terms of Use, including use of a single EV Certificate Request in support of multiple EV Code Signing Certificates containing the same Subject to the extent permitted under [Section 3.2.2.2.8](#32228-verification-of-signature-on-subscriber-agreement-and-ev-code-signing-certificate-requests) and [Section 3.2.2.2.9](#32229-verification-of-approval-of-ev-code-signing-certificate-request-).
4. The CA MUST repeat the verification process required in these Guidelines for any information obtained outside the time limits specified above except when permitted otherwise under [Section 4.2.1.1.1](#42111-validation-for-existing-ev-subscribers).

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

CAs MUST NOT issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity that the CA determined intentionally signed Suspect Code. The CA MUST keep meta-data about the reason for revoking a Code Signing Certificate as proof that the Code Signing Certificate was not revoked because the Applicant was intentionally signing Suspect Code.

CAs MAY issue new or replacement Code Signing Certificates to an entity who is the victim of a documented Takeover Attack, resulting in a loss of control of the Private Key associated with their Code Signing Certificate.

Except where issuance is expressly authorized by the Application Software Supplier, CAs MUST not issue new Code Signing Certificates to an entity where the CA is aware that the entity has been the victim of two Takeover Attacks or where the CA is aware that entity breached a requirement under this Section to protect Private Keys under [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(1) or [Section 6.2.7.4.1](#62741-subscriber-private-key-protection)(2).

Effective 2024-04-15, the CA SHALL treat revocation of Certificates in accordance with Section 4.9 specified in these Requirements.

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

When revocation of a Subscriber Certificate is done due to a Key Compromise or use in Suspect Code the CA SHALL determine an appropriate value for the revocationDate based on its own investigation. The CA SHALL set a historic date as revocationDate if deemed appropriate.

#### 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate
 
The CA SHALL revoke a Certificate within 24 hours if one or more of the following occurs:
 
1. The Subscriber requests in writing that the CA revoke the Certificate;
2. The Subscriber notifies the CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The CA obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise;
4. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate;
5. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber’s Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed; or
6. The CA has reasonable assurance that a Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code.
 
The CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and SHALL revoke a Certificate within 5 days if one or more of the following occurs:

7. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of Section 6.1.5 and Section 6.1.6; 
8. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused. 
9. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use. 
10. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate. 
11. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. 
12. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate. 
13. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository. 
14. Revocation is required by the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. 
 
The CA MAY delay revocation based on a request from Application Software Suppliers where immediate revocation has a potentially large negative impact to the ecosystem.

 
**Note:** Nothing herein prohibits a CA from revoking a Code Signing Certificate prior to these time frames.
 
#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate
 
The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:
 
1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
4. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
5. The Issuing CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
6. The Issuing CA determines that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;
7. The Issuing CA or Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide revocation support for the Certificate;
8. The Issuing CA's or Subordinate CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository; or
9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.
 

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The CA MUST provide Anti-Malware Organizations, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions on how they can report suspected Private Key compromise, Certificate misuse, Certificates used to sign Suspect Code, Takeover Attacks, or other types of possible fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA MUST publicly disclose the instructions on its website.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

The CA MUST maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to communicate with Anti-Malware Organizations, Application Software Suppliers, and law enforcement agencies and respond to high-priority Certificate Problem Reports, such as reports requesting revocation of Certificates used to sign malicious code, fraud, or other illegal conduct.

The CA MUST acknowledge receipt of plausible notices about Suspect Code signed with a certificate issued by the CA or a Subordinate CA.

The CA MUST begin investigating Certificate Problem Reports within twenty-four hours of receipt, and decide whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted based on at least the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (adware, spyware, malware, software bug, etc.),
2. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber,
3. The entity making the report (for example, a notification from an Anti-Malware Organization or law enforcement agency carries more weight than an anonymous complaint), and
4. Relevant legislation.

When revoking a Certificate, the CA SHOULD work with the Subscriber to estimate a date of when the revocation should occur in order to mitigate the impact of revocation on validly signed Code. For key compromise events, this date SHOULD be the earliest date of suspected compromise.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

A Certificate MAY have a one-to-one relationship or one-to-many relationship with the signed Code. Regardless, revocation of a Certificate may invalidate the Code Signatures on all signed Code, some of which could be perfectly sound. Because of this, the CA MAY specify the time at which the Certificate is first considered to be invalid in the `revocationDate` field of a CRL entry or the `revocationTime` field of an OCSP response to time-bind the set of software affected by the revocation[^*], and software should continue to treat objects containing a timestamp dated before the revocation date as valid.

[^*]: Backdating the `revocationDate` field is an exception to best practice described in RFC 5280 (section 5.3.2); however, these Requirements specify the use of the `revocationDate` field to convey the “invalidity date” to support Application Software Supplier software implementations that process the `revocationDate` field as the date when the Certificate is first considered to be invalid.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: 

* The Issuing CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate. The `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:

* The Subordinate CA SHALL publish a CRL, then update and reissue a CRL at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:

* The Subordinate CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs

No stipulation.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
   revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as
defined by RFC6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

Effective 2023-09-15, OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019.

Effective 2023-09-15, the validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the `thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate` field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

CAs MAY provide OCSP responses for Code Signing Certificates and Timestamp Certificates for the time period specified in their CPS, which MAY be at least 10 years after the expiration of the certificate.

If the CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL support an OCSP capability using the GET method for Certificates issued in accordance with these Requirements.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:

* If the Issuing CA provides OCSP responses, the Issuing CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

For the status of Code Signing Certificates:

* If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every four days. OCSP responses from this service MUST have a maximum expiration time of ten days.

For the status of Timestamp Certificates:

* If the Subordinate CA provides OCSP responses, the Subordinate CA SHALL update information provided via an OCSP response at least every twelve months and within 24 hours after revoking a Timestamp Certificate.

A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate serial number that is not "assigned", then the responder MUST NOT respond with a "good" status.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

Because some Application Software Suppliers utilize non-standard revocation mechanisms, CAs MUST, if requested by the Application Software Supplier and using a method of communication specified by the Application Software Vendor, notify the Application Software Supplier whenever the CA revokes a Code Signing Certificate because (i) the CA mis-issued the Certificate, (ii) the Certificate was used to sign Suspect Code, or (iii) there is a suspected or actual compromise of the Applicant's or CA's Private Key.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise

See [Section 4.9.1](#491-circumstances-for-revocation).

### 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension

Effective 2023-09-15, the Repository MUST NOT include entries that indicate that a Certificate is suspended.

### 4.9.14 Who can request suspension

Not applicable.

# 5. FACILITY, MANAGEMENT, AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

The CA/Browser Forum's Network and Certificate System Security Requirements are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

The CA SHALL develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive security program designed to:

1. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
2. Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
3. Protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
4. Protect against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes; and
5. Comply with all other security requirements applicable to the CA by law.

The Certificate Management Process MUST include:

1. physical security and environmental controls;
2. system integrity controls, including configuration management, integrity maintenance of trusted code, and malware detection/prevention;
3. network security and firewall management, including port restrictions and IP address filtering;
4. user management, separate trusted-role assignments, education, awareness, and training; and
5. logical access controls, activity logging, and inactivity time-outs to provide individual accountability.

The CA's security program MUST include an annual risk assessment that:

1. Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
2. Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and
3. Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.

Based on the risk assessment, the CA SHALL develop, implement, and maintain a security plan consisting of security procedures, measures, and products designed to achieve the objectives set forth above and to manage and control the risks identified during the risk assessment, commensurate with the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan MUST include administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan MUST also take into account then-available technology and the cost of implementing the specific measures, and SHALL implement a reasonable level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a breach of security and the nature of the data to be protected.

The Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence steps, as outlined in [Section 3.2.9](#32229-verification-of-approval-of-ev-code-signing-certificate-request-), MAY be performed by one of the persons. For example, one Validation Specialist MAY review and verify all the Applicant information and a second Validation Specialist MAY approve issuance of the EV Certificate.
2. Such controls MUST be auditable.

## 5.3 Personnel controls

### 5.3.1 Qualifications, experience, and clearance requirements

Prior to the engagement of any person in the Certificate Management Process, whether as an employee, agent, or an independent contractor of the CA, the CA SHALL verify the identity and trustworthiness of such person.

### 5.3.2 Background check procedures

Prior to the commencement of employment of any person by the CA for engagement in the EV Processes, whether as an employee, agent, or an independent contractor of the CA, the CA MUST:

1. **Verify the identity of such person**: Verification of identity MUST be performed through:

   1. The personal (physical) presence of such person before trusted persons who perform human resource or security functions, and
   2. The verification of well-recognized forms of government-issued photo identification (e.g., passports and/or drivers licenses);

   __Contents__: If present, this field MUST contain a Registration Reference for a Legal Entity assigned in accordance to the identified Registration Scheme.

* The organizationIdentifier MUST be encoded as a PrintableString or UTF8String.
* The Registration Scheme MUST be identified using the using the following structure in the presented order:
   * 3 character Registration Scheme identifier;
   * 2 character ISO 3166 country code for the nation in which the Registration Scheme is operated, or if the scheme is operated globally ISO 3166 code "XG" shall be used;
   * For the NTR Registration Scheme identifier, if required under [Section 7.1.4.2.4 (c)](#71424-subject-distinguished-name-fields---ev-code-signing-certificates), a 2 character ISO 3166-2 identifier for the subdivision (state or province) of the nation in which the Registration Scheme is operated, preceded by plus "+" (0x2B (ASCII), U+002B (UTF-8));
   * a hyphen-minus "-" (0x2D (ASCII), U+002D (UTF-8));
   * Registration Reference allocated in accordance with the identified Registration Scheme

   Note: Registration References MAY contain hyphens, but Registration Schemes, ISO 3166 country codes, and ISO 3166-2 identifiers do not.  Therefore if more than one hyphen appears in the structure, the leftmost hyphen is a separator, and the remaining hyphens are part of the Registration Reference.

   * As in Section 7.1.4.2.4 (c), the specified location information MUST match the scope of the registration being referenced.

   * Registration Schemes listed in [Appendix H](#appendix-h--registration-schemes) are currently recognized as valid under these guidelines.

  * The CA SHALL:

     1. confirm that the organization represented by the Registration Reference is the same as the organization named in the `organizationName` field as specified in 7.1.4.2.4 (a) within the context of the subject’s jurisdiction as specified in 7.1.4.2.4 (c);
     2. further verify the Registration Reference matches other information verified in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-authentication-of-organization-identity-for-ev-code-signing-certificates);
     3. take appropriate measures to disambiguate between different organizations as described in [Appendix H](#appendix-h--registration-schemes) for each Registration Scheme;
     4. Apply the validation rules relevant to the Registration Scheme as specified in [Appendix H](#appendix-h--registration-schemes).

### 7.1.5 Name constraints

### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

This section sets forth minimum requirements for the content of the Subscriber, Subordinate CA, and Root CA Certificates, as they relate to the identification of Certificate Policy.

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) code signing(1)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.1`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for EV Code Signing Certificates follows:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(3)}` (`2.23.140.1.3`)

The following Certificate Policy Identifier is reserved for use by CAs as a required means of asserting compliance with these Requirements for Timestamp Certificates:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) code-signing-requirements(4) timestamping(2)}` (`2.23.140.1.4.2`)

#### 7.1.6.2 Root CA Certificates

A Root CA Certificate SHOULD NOT contain the certificatePolicies extension.

#### 7.1.6.3 Subordinate CA Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is not an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the policy identifier that indicates the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements (i.e. either the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifiers as specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) or identifiers defined by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement), and
2. MUST NOT contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`).

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that issues Code Signing Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to indicate the Subordinate CA's compliance with these Requirements, and
2. MAY contain the "anyPolicy" identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier.

A Certificate issued after 31 March 2022 to a Subordinate CA that issues Timestamp Certificates and is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include the CA/Browser Forum reserved identifier specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) to 
indicate the Subordinate CA’s compliance with these Requirements, and  
2. MAY contain the “anyPolicy” identifier (`2.5.29.32.0`) in place of an explicit policy identifier. 

A Subordinate CA MUST represent, in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, that all Certificates containing a policy identifier indicating compliance with these Requirements are issued and managed in accordance with these Requirements.

####  7.1.6.4  Subscriber Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subscriber MUST contain one or more policy identifier(s), defined by the CA, in the Certificate's certificatePolicies extension that indicates adherence to and compliance with these Requirements. CAs complying with these Requirements MAY also assert the reserved policy OIDs in such Certificates.

The CA MUST document in its Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement that the Certificates it issues containing the specified policy identifier(s) are managed in accordance with these Requirements.

### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints extension

### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

## 7.2 CRL profile

The serial number of a revoked Certificate MUST remain on the CRL for at least 10 years after the expiration of the Certificate. Application Software Suppliers MAY require the CA to support a longer life-time in its contract with the CA. If a Code Signing Certificate contains the Lifetime Signing OID, the Code Signature becomes invalid when the Code Signing Certificate expires, even if the Code Signature is timestamped. Because the Lifetime Signing OID is intended to be used with test purposes only, a CA MAY cease maintaining revocation information for a Code Signing Certificate with the Lifetime Signing OID after the Code Signing Certificate expires.

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent CRL entries for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.2.1 Version number(s)

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

If a CRL has a `thisUpdate` field value of 2022-07-01 00:00:00 UTC or later and the CA includes the Invalidity Date CRL entry extension in a CRL entry for a Code Signing Certificate, then the time encoded in the Invalidity Date CRL extension SHALL be equal to the time encoded in the `revocationDate` field of the CRL entry.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

If a Code Signing Certificate previously has been revoked, and the CA later becomes aware of a more appropriate revocation date, then the CA MAY use that revocation date in subsequent OCSP responses for that Code Signing Certificate.

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA and/or all Signing Services MUST, at all times:

1. Comply with all laws applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in each jurisdiction where it operates,
2. Comply with these Requirements,
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section, and
4. If a CA, be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.
5. In all cases, the CA MUST contractually obligate each Delegated Third Party to comply with all applicable requirements in these Requirements and to perform them as required of the CA itself. The CA MUST enforce these obligations and internally audit each Delegated Third Party’s compliance with these Requirements on an annual basis. 

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST be fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Code Signing Certificates, the CA MUST successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment MUST be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Code Signing Certificates and MUST be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Code Signing Certificate.

Audits MUST be conducted for all obligations under these Guidelines, including the operations of Timestamp Authorities and Signing Services. Functions performed by a Delegated Third Party MUST be included in the CA's audit or the CA MUST obtain an audit report from the Delegated Third Party. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA MUST not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party MUST NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit).

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));

1. The Applicant’s agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA, or
2. The Applicant’s acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the certificate request. The CA MAY use an electronic or “click‐through” Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each certificate request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future certificate requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber MUST represent that it will generate and operate any device storing Private Keys in a secure manner, as described in a document of code signing best practices, which the CA MUST provide to the Subscriber during the ordering process. The CA MUST obligate the Subscriber to use passwords that are randomly generated with at least 16 characters containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to transport Private Keys.
3. **Private Key Reuse:** To not apply for a Code Signing Certificate if the Public Key in the Certificate is or will be used with a non-Code Signing Certificate.

12. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance:** An acknowledgement and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the Terms of Use or the Subscriber Agreement.

### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

The CA MUST contractually obligate each Signing Service to inform the CA if the Signing Service becomes aware (by whatever means) that the Signing Service has signed Suspect Code. The CA MUST require the Signing Service to request revocation of the affected Certificate and provide immediate notice to the CA if a Subscriber's Private Key, or Private Key activation data, is compromised or believed to be compromised.

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

## 9.8 Limitations of liability

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

For Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

For EV Code Signing Certificates, CAs MAY limit their liability as described in this Section 9.8 for Non-EV Code Signing Certificates, but MUST NOT limit its liability to Subscribers or Relying Parties for legally recognized and provable claims to a monetary amount less than two thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per EV Code Signing Certificate.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

# Appendix D - Country-Specific Interpretative Guidelines (Normative)

NOTE: This appendix provides alternative interpretations of the EV Guidelines for countries that have a language, cultural, technical, or legal reason for deviating from a strict interpretation of the EV Guidelines.  More specific information for particular countries may be added to this appendix in the future.

## 1. Organization Names

1. Non-Latin Organization Name

   Where an EV Applicant's organization name is not registered with a QGIS in _Latin_ characters and the Applicant's foreign character organization name and registration have been verified with a QGIS in accordance with these Guidelines, a CA MAY include a Latin character organization name in the EV Certificate.  In such a case, the CA MUST follow the procedures laid down in this section.

2. Romanized Names

   In order to include a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name, the Romanization MUST be verified by the CA using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation.

   If the CA can not rely on a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, then it MUST rely on one of the options below, in order of preference:

   1. A system recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO);
   2. A system recognized by the United Nations; or
   3. A Lawyer's Opinion or Accountant's Letter confirming the proper Romanization of the registered name.

3. Translated Name

   In order to include a Latin character name in the EV certificate that is not a direct Romanization of the registered name (e.g. an English Name)  the CA MUST verify that the Latin character name is:

   1. Included in the Articles of Incorporation (or equivalent document) filed as part of the organization registration; or
   2. Recognized by a QTIS in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation as the Applicant's recognized name for tax filings; or
   3. Confirmed with a QIIS to be the name associated with the registered organization; or
   4. Confirmed by a Verified Legal Opinion or Accountant's Letter to be a translated trading name associated with the registered organization.

### Country-Specific Procedures

#### D-1. Japan

As interpretation of the procedures set out above:

1. Organization Names

   1. The Revised Hepburn method of Romanization, as well as Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki methods described in ISO 3602, are acceptable for Japanese Romanizations.
   2. The CA MAY verify the Romanized transliteration, language translation (e.g. English name), or other recognized Roman-letter substitute of the Applicant's formal legal name with either a QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter.
   3. The CA MAY use the Financial Services Agency to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name.  When used, the CA MUST verify that the translated English is recorded in the audited Financial Statements.
   4. When relying on Articles of Incorporation to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name, the Articles of Incorporation MUST be accompanied either: by a document, signed with the original Japanese Corporate Stamp, that proves that the Articles of Incorporation are authentic and current, or by a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant Letter.  The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Corporate Stamp.
   5. A Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-lettered substitute name confirmed in accordance with this [Appendix D-1](#d-1-japan) stored in the ROBINS database operated by JIPDEC MAY be relied upon by a CA for determining the allowed organization name during any issuance or renewal process of an EV Certificate without the need to re-perform the above procedures.

2. Accounting Practitioner

   In Japan:

   1. Accounting Practitioner includes either a certified public accountant (公認会計士 - Konin-kaikei-shi) or a licensed tax accountant (税理士 – Zei-ri-shi).
   2. The CA MUST verify the professional status of the Accounting Practitioner through direct contact with the relevant local member association that is affiliated with either the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([http://www.hp.jicpa.or.jp](http://www.hp.jicpa.or.jp/)), the Japan Federation of Certified Tax Accountant's Associations ([http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp](http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp/)), or any other authoritative source recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Finance ([http://www.mof.go.jp](http://www.mof.go.jp/)) as providing the current registration status of such professionals.

3. Legal Practitioner

   In Japan:

   1. Legal Practitioner includes any of the following:

       - a licensed lawyer (弁護士 - Ben-go-shi),
       - a judicial scrivener (司法書士 - Shiho-sho-shi lawyer),
       - an administrative solicitor (行政書士 - Gyosei-sho-shi Lawyer),
       - or a notary public (公証人 - Ko-sho-nin).

       For purposes of the EV Guidelines, a Japanese Notary Public is considered equivalent to a Latin Notary.

   2. The CA MUST verify the professional status of the Legal Practitioner by direct contact through the relevant local member association that is affiliated with one of the following national associations:

       - the Japan Federation of Bar Associations ([http://www.nichibenren.or.jp](http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/)),

       - the Japan Federation of Administrative Solicitors ([http://www.gyosei.or.jp](http://www.gyosei.or.jp/)),
       - the Japan National Notaries Association ([http://www.koshonin.gr.jp](http://www.koshonin.gr.jp/)), or
       - any other authoritative source recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Justice ([http://www.moj.go.jp](http://www.moj.go.jp/)) as providing the current registration status of such professionals.

# Appendix E - Sample Contract Signer's Representation/Warranty (Informative)

A CA may rely on the Contract Signer's authority to enter into the Subscriber Agreement using a representation/warranty executed by the Contract Signer.  An example of an acceptable warranty is as follows:

[CA] and Applicant are entering into a legally valid and enforceable Subscriber Agreement that creates extensive obligations on Applicant.  An EV Certificate serves as a form of digital identity for Applicant.  The loss or misuse of this identity can result in great harm to the Applicant.  By signing this Subscriber Agreement, the contract signer acknowledges that they have the authority to obtain the digital equivalent of a company stamp, seal, or (where applicable) officer's signature to establish the authenticity of the company's website, and that [Applicant name] is responsible for all uses of its EV Certificate.  By signing this Agreement on behalf of [Applicant name], the contract signer represents that the contract signer

1. is acting as an authorized representative of [Applicant name],
2. is expressly authorized by [Applicant name] to sign Subscriber Agreements and approve EV Certificate requests on Applicant's behalf, and
3. has confirmed Applicant's right to use the domain(s) to be included in EV Certificates.
